Oh no! You've just been sucked into a wormhole and teleported
into an uncharted area of the universe! Luckily, your ship has
a warp drive so you can jump back home, but traveling through
the wormhole has temporarily disabled your warp drive system.

You're going to have to wait a while and defend yourself against
enemies while your system comes back online. Good luck!

Press Spacebar to begin the fight!
